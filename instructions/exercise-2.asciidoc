Manipulation planning
=====================

Objective
---------

Define a constraint graph and plan a manipulation path.

Introduction
------------
Open a terminal, cd into hpp-practicals directory and open 3 tab by typing CTRL+SHIFT+T
twice. In the first terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
hpp-manipulation-server
----

In the second terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
hpp-gui
----

In the third terminal, type
[source,sh]
----
cd script
python -i manipulation.py
----

You should see the above manipulator on a horizontal plane and a ball.
You can display the initial and goal configurations of the problem defined in
the script by typing respectively

[source,python]
----
r (q_init)
r (q_goal)
----

Displaying the constraint graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

in the python terminal. You can display the constraint graph by typing

[source,python]
----
graph.display (format='svg')
----

The graph should be displayed in a brower. By moving the mouse on
nodes and edges, you can see the constraints associated to each graph
element.

Solving the problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typing
[source,python]
----
ps.solve ()
----
should solve the problem in a minute or so.

Displaying the path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As in exercise 1, the path can be displayed using the path player
[source,python]
----
pp (0)
----

A more difficult problem
------------------------

script +manipulation_box.py+ defines the same problem as
+manipulation.py+, except that in the initial configuration, the ball
is in a box. The resolution takes a lot more time since RRT algorithm
needs to generate a lot of nodes before the gripper reaches the
initial configuration of the box.

Instructions
------------

In order to help the manipulation planner, define a constraint graph with
intermediate states like for instance:

- a state where the gripper is empty above the ball
- a state where the gripper holds the ball above the ground.

The graph below provides an example.

Hints
-----

Displaying the constraint graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type in a terminal

[source,sh]
----
hpp-plot-manipulation-graph
----
The following window should pop up.

image::hpp-plot-manipulation-graph.png[width="40%",alt="hpp-plot-manipulation-graph"]

Click on buttons "Refresh" and "Statistics" to display the current constraint graph.

By clicking on edges, you can see some statistics about the roadmap extension.
